## Description

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game built using React. The game allows two players to take turns and try to align three of their respective symbols (X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on the 3x3 board. The first player to achieve this wins the game.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was used to create the interactive components and manage the game state.
- CSS: Cascading Style Sheets were used to style the game components and create an appealing user interface.
- HTML: The structure of the game is created using HTML elements.
- GitHub: The project is version-controlled using Git and hosted on GitHub for easy collaboration and sharing.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server and open the game in your default browser.
4. Two players can take turns by clicking on an empty cell on the board.
5. The game will notify you when a player wins or when the game ends in a draw.
6. Click the "Restart" button to start a new game.
